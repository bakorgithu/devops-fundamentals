## This doc helps us to understand the basics of devops fundamentals 

Core principles of devops.

Collaboration and Communication: DevOps fosters a culture where development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams work closely together, breaking down traditional silos. This collaboration extends to other stakeholders, including quality assurance and security teams, ensuring that everyone involved in the software lifecycle is aligned towards common goals.
Automation: A key tenet of DevOps is the automation of various stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This includes automating testing, integration, deployment, and infrastructure management. Automation helps reduce manual errors, speeds up processes, and allows teams to focus on more strategic tasks.
Continuous Integration (CI): CI is a practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a central repository. Automated builds and tests run with each change, allowing teams to detect issues early in the development process. This practice enhances code quality and reduces integration problems.
Continuous Delivery (CD): Building on CI, CD ensures that code changes are automatically prepared for release to production. This involves automated testing and deployment processes that allow for reliable releases at any time, enabling organizations to respond quickly to market demands.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC):IaC involves managing infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. This practice allows for consistent and repeatable provisioning of environments, making it easier to scale applications and manage configurations.
Monitoring and Logging; Continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure is crucial in a DevOps environment. It provides real-time insights into system performance, enabling teams to quickly identify and resolve issues before they impact users.

Benefits of Adopting DevOps.

Faster Time to Market*: By streamlining processes through automation and collaboration, organizations can accelerate their development cycles, allowing them to deliver new features and updates more rapidly.
Improved Quality: The integration of automated testing within CI/CD pipelines helps ensure that software is rigorously tested before deployment, leading to higher quality products with fewer defects.
Increased Efficiency: Automation reduces repetitive tasks, freeing up team members to focus on higher-value activities. This efficiency leads to better resource utilization and productivity.
Enhanced Customer Satisfaction: With the ability to release updates more frequently based on user feedback, organizations can better meet customer needs and adapt to changing market conditions.

The DevOps Lifecycle

Planning: Identifying features and improvements based on user feedback.
 Coding: Writing code collaboratively using version control systems like Git.
 Building: Compiling code into deployable artifacts.
Testing: Running automated tests to ensure functionality.
Packaging: Preparing applications for deployment.
Releasing: Deploying applications into production environments.
 Monitoring: Continuously observing application performance post-deployment.
Feedback: Gathering user feedback for future iterations.
