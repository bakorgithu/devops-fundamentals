1. Deployment
Purpose:
Used to deploy stateless applications or services.
Ensures a specified number of identical replicas of a pod are running.
Handles rolling updates, rollbacks, scaling, and self-healing of pods.
Key Features:
Stateless pods: No affinity between pods or reliance on persistent data.
Pods are assigned randomly to nodes.
Rolling updates to deploy new versions of the application.
Easily scales up/down replicas.
Use Cases:
Web servers (e.g., NGINX, Apache).
REST APIs.
Microservices-based applications.

2. DaemonSet
Purpose:
Ensures that a single pod runs on every node (or a subset of nodes based on selectors).
Commonly used for running system-level or cluster-level services.
Key Features:
Pods are scheduled one per node.
Automatically deploys pods on new nodes when they are added to the cluster.
Does not handle scaling (it is tied to the number of nodes).
Use Cases:
Node monitoring (e.g., Prometheus Node Exporter, Datadog agents).
Log collection (e.g., Fluentd, Filebeat).
Networking agents (e.g., Calico, Cilium).

3. StatefulSet
Purpose:
Used to deploy stateful applications that require stable, persistent identities and storage.
Ensures ordered deployment and scaling of pods.
Maintains a stable network identity for each pod (e.g., pod-0, pod-1, pod-2).
Key Features:
Pods have unique, persistent identities (e.g., pod-0, pod-1).
Provides ordered deployment, scaling, and deletion (ensures sequential operations).
Works with PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) to ensure each pod has its own storage.
Pods retain their state and identity across restarts.
Use Cases:
Databases (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra).
Distributed systems (e.g., Kafka, Zookeeper).
Stateful applications that rely on unique pod identities.

Comparison Table
Feature	Deployment	DaemonSet	StatefulSet
Purpose	Deploy stateless applications	Run a pod on every (or selected) node	Deploy stateful applications
Pod Scheduling	Based on resource availability	One pod per node	Ordered scheduling (pod-0, pod-1)
Scaling	Scalable	Tied to the number of nodes	Scalable, but retains identity
Rolling Updates	Yes	No (manual update required)	Yes
Pod Identity	All pods are identical	All pods are identical	Unique pod identities
Persistent Storage	Not supported	Not supported	Supported (via PVC)
Use Case Examples	Web servers, APIs, stateless apps	Log collectors, monitoring agents	Databases, Kafka, Zookeeper


When to Use Each
Deployment: When you need stateless, scalable, and easily upgradable applications.
DaemonSet: When you need one pod per node for system or cluster-level tasks.
StatefulSet: When you need stable identities, persistent storage, and ordered operations for stateful apps.
